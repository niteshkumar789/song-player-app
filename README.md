## 🚀 Concepts Used

- `Encapsulation`: **Data hiding** with private members (Song, Playlist).
- `Composition`: Playlist contains multiple Song objects.
- `Abstraction`: User interacts with SongPlayerApp via menu, **hiding internal logic**.
- `Modularity`: Code split into separate header files for **maintainability**.
